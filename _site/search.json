    "text": "Use of AI\nArtificial intelligence (AI) can be an effective tool in data science. For example, AI-based programming assistants like GitHub Copilot or generative model platforms like ChatGPT now help programmers and developers to write better code in less time. Learning to use AI is essentially becoming a basic skill for the modern data scientist. Because of this, I do not want to completely discourage the use of AI assistance.\nHowever, I ask that you avoid using AI platforms or tools in a manner that is inappropriate in the context of this course. This course teaches a variety of concepts, skills, and critical thinking. Using AI in such a way as to avoid learning, developing skills, or critical thinking is not appropriate. If you find yourself using AI to look up answers, search for complete solutions to problems, or things like this, then your use of AI is not acceptable. It might be helpful to think of AI as an analog to a calculator. If the goal of an assignment is for you to demonstrate that you can do a certain calculation, then using a calculator is not appropriate. On the other hand, if the goal of an assignment is for you to demonstrate that you can solve a problem for which a minor step involves doing a calculation, then using a calculator is okay. AI should be treated analogously.\nIn particular, it is expected that students will be able to explain independently and in detail what any line of code submitted as part of an assignment this semester does. Also, it is expected that students can explain independently and in detail the solution to any problem submitted as part of an assignment this semester.\nIf you have any doubts about your use of AI, then either ask the instructor if your use of AI is acceptable or just don’t use AI."

    "section": "Review of the Data Science Workflow",
    "text": "Review of the Data Science Workflow\nBefore starting our exploration of machine learning, let’s review the basic data science workflow as covered in an introductory level data science course. Generally, the steps in the workflow are:\n\nGather data with the goal of using it to gain insight to answer questions or address problems in a specific domain of application. If you’re going to use machine learning as part of your data analysis, this is a good place to make sure that you have enough data and also to split your data into a training set and test set.\nDocument the data and data collection process.\n\nIt is important to think carefully about the type of data that is collected and how the data is generated and collected. Data is often generated or collected in such a way that it will contain or reflect biases, misinformation, incomplete information, or other problematic features. When you use data or models to make a decision, the problematic features of the data may influence the decision made with unforeseen negative consequences. See The Alignment Problem by Brian Christian for a thoughtful discussion on the issues related to these types of considerations (Christian 2020).\n\nImport the data for analysis. If you have not already, you may want to split your data into a training set and test set.\nExplore and clean the data. Data visualization is essential at this step.\nGenerate initial insight or more detailed questions.\nDecide what type(s) of analysis or analyses are to be performed. This is the stage at which machine learning enters into the process.\n\nMake sure to clearly state what the goals of an analysis are. There are several different types of analyses of data that are common to conduct. See Table 1.1 from (timbers2022data?) for a list of these typical analysis types with corresponding examples of questions appropriate for a particular type of analysis, link to table here.\n\nAssess the analysis. In particular, use an appropriate metric to estimate model error.\nAt this stage, it may be necessary to repeat steps 1 - 7.\nReport your findings/results documenting each step in the analysis, and state your conclusions in the context of the question, problem, or application that motivated your analysis.\n\nIt is essential the our data science workflow be reproducible and auditable.

Generally, the steps in the workflow are:\n\nGather data with the goal of using it to gain insight to answer questions or address problems in a specific domain of application. If you’re going to use machine learning as part of your data analysis, this is a good place to make sure that you have enough data and also to split your data into a training set and test set.\nDocument the data and data collection process.\n\nIt is important to think carefully about the type of data that is collected and how the data is generated and collected. Data is often generated or collected in such a way that it will contain or reflect biases, misinformation, incomplete information, or other problematic features. When you use data or models to make a decision, the problematic features of the data may influence the decision made with unforeseen negative consequences. See The Alignment Problem by Brian Christian for a thoughtful discussion on the issues related to these types of considerations (Christian 2020).\n\nImport the data for analysis. If you have not already, you may want to split your data into a training set and test set.\nExplore and clean the data. Data visualization is essential at this step.\nGenerate initial insight or more detailed questions.\nDecide what type(s) of analysis or analyses are to be performed. This is the stage at which machine learning enters into the process.\n\nMake sure to clearly state what the goals of an analysis are. There are several different types of analyses of data that are common to conduct. See Table 1.1 from (timbers2022data?) for a list of these typical analysis types with corresponding examples of questions appropriate for a particular type of analysis, link to table here.\n\nAssess the analysis. In particular, use an appropriate metric to estimate model error.\nAt this stage, it may be necessary to repeat steps 1 - 7.\nReport your findings/results documenting each step in the analysis, and state your conclusions in the context of the question, problem, or application that motivated your analysis.\n\nIt is essential the our data science workflow be reproducible and auditable. That is, each step in a data analysis should be accessible and understandable to others (auditability) and anyone with access to your analysis should be able to re-run the analysis from start to finish and get the same result you did (reproducibility).
