## Course Overview

This course provides a coverage of essential topics in data science at the intermediate level with an emphasis on machine learning. Broadly, we will cover algorithms that are commonly used for gaining insight from data. The things you learn in the class will be applicable in a variety of different areas, professions, and even other classes.

There is a website for the course, link [here](https://knowledge-discovery.netlify.app/). For course logistics, see the official course syllabus available [here](https://knowledge-discovery.netlify.app/syllabus.html). Assignments and other information specific to the course in a given semester will be posted on the course learning management system. The course website provides links to many additional resources available [here](https://knowledge-discovery.netlify.app/links.html).

While we will refer often to several texts (most of which have been published online as open access materials) throughout the course, most of the content will be delivered via ``notebooks'' like the one you're reading now[^1] that intermix text, mathematical notation, figures, programming language code, and web links. In some cases, you will be asked to go through the notebooks on your own and some times we will go through the notebooks together. Either way, anytime you encounter code in a notebook, it is expected that you will take the time to run any code (mostly by copying and pasting) for yourself. The only way to master the material is through active participation.  

[^1]: The notebooks are created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), topics that we will cover in more detail later.
